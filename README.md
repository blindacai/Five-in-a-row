**version 1:** directly write to the DOM


**version 2:**
you should not write to dom directly

save the state of the game to some objects

create a render function to produce html to be inserted into the dom

when the source of truth is the DOM, pull it out and save it in an js object
separate the state of the game from UI

problem: how to deal with the state of your app along with the browser's state (eg: where the cursur is)
         how to do partial page rendering


**version 3:**
use a library for the render logic

use react.js

All React components must act like pure functions with respect to their props

There are two types of data that control a component: props and state

props are set by the parent and they are fixed throughout the lifetime of a component

For data that is going to change, we have to use state

When you want to aggregate data from multiple children or to have two child components communicate with each other,
move the state upwards so that it lives in the parent component. The parent can then pass the state back down to the children 
via props, so that the child components are always in sync with each other and with the parent.

const means that the identifier(variable in this case) canâ€™t be reassigned (it's read only),
but the object the identifier refer to can be mutable

So it looks similar to keyword final in Java


**Questions**
Why object being immutable is important
